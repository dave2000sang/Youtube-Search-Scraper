# Youtube-Search-Scraper


- YouTube search scraper from www.youtube.com. 
- User enters search item on the web page (running on localhost) which is connected to a node.js server (by Express API) 
and then POST requests a background python script that finally scrapes the web-site generated from the user input.
- Outputs a .csv file containing Names of all YouTube videos and their corresponding links


Future Extensions of Project:
- Automate entire procedure (run everything in background?)
- Display .csv results onto web page
- Beautify front-end web page
- Improve error handling
- Add download links to scraped links
